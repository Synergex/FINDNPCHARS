**Description:** Previous versions of Synergy allowed for embedded characters in the code for Carriage Return, Line Feed and Null. Due to changes in the version 9 compiler, these characters are not recognized properly and can return incorrect results. This program will search for any .DBL files in the directory it is placed in, parse each line and look for the embedded characters, if found, the file name and line number where the embedded character was found will be displayed.<br />
**Platforms:** Windows; Unix; OpenVMS<br />
